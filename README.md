### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**andrew-johnson1/andrew-johnson1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in AerE 361 at Iowa State University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about vehicle propulsion, c programming, as well as statistics and accounting.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about sports & religion! I am a Christian and have loved sports since I was a kid, and always love talking about those things with folk!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in Connecticut my entire life before coming to college here at Iowa State 4 years ago!

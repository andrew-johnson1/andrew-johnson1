### Hi there 👋

<!--
**andrew-johnson1/andrew-johnson1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working in AerE 361 at Iowa State University.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about vehicle propulsion, c programming, as well as statistics and accounting.
- 💬 Ask me about sports & religion! I am a Christian and have love sports since I was a kid, and always love talking about those things with folk!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in Connecticut my entire life before coming to college here at Iowa State 4 years ago!
